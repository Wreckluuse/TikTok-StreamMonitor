- Marbles?

- event box

- full timer rewrite

- potentially abstract list item element into special list component

- add colour for streamer and colour options to chatbox

- currently working on refactoring storage and state management, PLEASE FINISH BEFORE MOVING ON
-- come back to this, please try to follow rule of 3 repetitions and abstract storage system in a more concise way.

- partial rewrite of chatbox to better suit new storage configuration
-- main idea here is to try handling colour and all of the message variables to be handled within the component
and export them. also add settings function that lets you select the colour of each role

- finish fixing event formatting, use gift portion of event box as blueprint and fix the others.

- make furthest left column of events background the users pfp, make it less wide, put their name as a clickable link in the top left? or center idk
